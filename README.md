## Programing Language
We will be using Python 3.6 for this project. A virtual environment can 
easily be created by running:
```bash
virtualenv --python=python3.6 dlai-env
source dlai-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

In `requirements.txt` you will find any python dependency needed
 to run the code.

## Abstract

The project will consist in implementing from scratch with Keras and
Tensorflow the pipeline described in the 
[Colorful Image Colorization paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf) which consists in generating realistic colorizations, given a grayscale photograph as input.
